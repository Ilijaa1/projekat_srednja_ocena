# project_average_grade
JS project for calculating the average grade. In this project, I created a program for calculating
average site rating. It has a total of 7 input fields: first field: The first field is made for entering link of web-site. 
second field: The second field is made for effort evaluation. third field: The third field is designed to evaulate the functionality of the website.
fourth field: The fourth field is made to rate the responsiveness of the website.
fifth field: The fifth field is made for design assessment.
sixth field: The sixth field is made for evaluating the source code.
seventh field: The seventh field is designed to assess the developer's skills.
